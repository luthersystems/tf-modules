1. tiller has a cluster-admin role (bad)

2. the ui container binds to port 80 and I opened the security group wider than was advised (unknown implications)

3. no rbac for ui container (bad)

4. containers are allowed to hit the ec2 metadata api and (some) make use make use of its IAM instance policy (bad).

5. tiller installed with an "insecure 'allow unauthenticated users' policy" and should instead be installed with the --tiller-tls-verify flag (bad) -- See https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#securing-your-helm-installation.

6. Helm is installed via an unofficial/unverified snap publisher.

7. There is no network policy engine installed (bad) -- See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html

8. Luther users (admins) have system:masters group membership and whoever
creates the cluster has (perma?) system:masters membership (could be better).

9. Using TCP readiness/liveness checks for gRPC services instead of a real health check: https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/01/health-checking-grpc-servers-on-kubernetes/

10. The kubernetes dashboard is not running (meh)
